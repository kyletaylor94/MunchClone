# MunchClone

MunchClone is a SwiftUI-based project that I've cloned to showcase my skills as a developer. This project is a demonstration of my ability to understand and recreate existing applications. It's important to note that this is a clone of an existing app and is intended solely for educational and portfolio purposes.

Showcases proficiency in UI layout, navigation, and data presentation.
Incorporates Firebase for backend services such as user authentication and data storage.
Integrates Lottie animations to enhance the user experience and add engaging visuals.
Utilizes Kingfisher library for efficient downloading and caching of remote images.
